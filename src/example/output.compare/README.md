# Test Harness Example Outputs

Example files outputted by two different test harness runs for the regions [BR_R002](BR_R002) and [KR_R002](KR_R002), as well as descriptions of the outputs, are saved here.

These example files can be used to verify a local run of the test harness. See [example](../README.md).
