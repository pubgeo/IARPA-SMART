# About this repository

The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) led the development of a large dataset containing spatio-temporal annotations of large scale heavy construction activity. 

TODO: ADD MORE

## Terminology

- Observation
- Site Model
- Region Model (picture of region model)

## Heavy Construction Annotation Dataset

- Define what heavy construction is and isn't (size, activity types, etc.)
- Pictures of heavy construction
- Chart showing how many sites are annotated in each region
- Map with locations of regions
- Distinction between different annotation types 

### File Format Specifications

The IARPA SMART Heavy Construction Annotation Dataset 

## Obtaining the Satellite Imagery

See [here](documentation/obtain_imagery.md) for more information on obtaining the satellite imagery corresponding to this dataset.
